                <p>Rugby is a sport made for hooligans but its played by men.
                    You don't need a lot of equipment, just a pair of cleats, a mouthguard, and a jersey and some shorts
                    and
                    a ball. It can be played by anyone, men, women, and children.It is a very inclusive sport. The game
                    is
                    mostly played by the nations of the British Commonwealth. But other countries around the world play
                    it.
                    This sport teaches respect, camaraderie and other character building traits. There are two from of
                    rugby. The first is called Rugby Union and the other is Rugby League. These two iterations of the
                    sport
                    are very similar but have different rules. On this site we will explore Rugby Union. Links for both
